<h1 align="center"> Section 3) Econometric method for cross-sectional data and panel data </h1> 
<hr /> 

In order to test the growth-enhancing view of financial development presented by Pagano’s ‘AK model’ and Levine’s ‘functional approach’ in section 1, I follow the techniques adopted by Levine et al. (2000) to extract the exogenous component of financial development and examine how this affects economic growth (Levine, et al., 2000). Firstly, I produce a cross-sectional dataset (consisting of variables taken at a given point in time) and a panel dataset (consisting of a time series for each cross-sectional variable). I use the cross-sectional dataset to run a Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression, in which I instrument a country’s financial development by its legal origin. As for the panel dataset, I run two different 2SLS regressions: a ‘difference’ regression (in which I take the first-difference of each variable and instrument them by their lagged values) and a ‘levels’ regression (in which I do not first-difference the variables but I do instrument them by their lagged-difference values). Data-wise, I use the World Bank to gather information on the explanatory and dependent variables and Daniel Treisman’s data on legal origins (Treisman, 2007).  

In terms of the explanatory variables, I use 3 of the 4 variables used in King and Levine (1993) to proxy for financial development: BANK, LLY and PRIVY. BANK compares commercial bank allocation decisions on savings compared to the central bank, LLY measures the relative size of the financial sector, and PRIVY measures the provision of financial services provided in a country (King & Levine, 1993). As for the dependent variable, I proxy economic growth for the cross-sectional dataset by GYP (real average long run GDP), and for the panel dataset by GROWTHRATE (real long run GDP). In terms of controlled variables, I use two of the three conditioning sets used by Levine et al.: the simple conditioning set (including the constant, log of initial income and the log of initial educational attainment) and the policy conditioning set (including the simple conditioning set along with government expenditure, inflation and a measure of trade). I control for these variables as they are assumed to affect the dependent variable (for example, initial income captures the convergence effect in which high income countries grow more slowly than low income countries (OpenStax, n.d.)). I proceed to prove the validity of the econometric method and how it addresses the endogeneity issues plaguing the finance-growth link.  

I begin by examining the benefits of using 2SLS regressions for resolving endogeneity issues. As shown by the literature review, the explanatory variables in the finance-growth relationship are not exogenous, in which case 2SLS is more efficient than OLS (Wooldridge, 2013, p. 534). With this improvement in efficiency, 2SLS will report lower standard errors, thus improving the precision of the estimation. In terms of the 2SLS technique, the first step involves using instruments to extract the exogenous component of the explanatory variable. In the second step, one regresses this exogenous component of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable. The process will mean that the explanatory variables are no longer jointly determined with the dependent variable, proving that simultaneity bias will not be driving the results. As shown by economists such as Odhiambo (2004) in section 2, simultaneity has been a big issue facing economists due to the existence of the “demand-following” response in which economic growth can fuel financial development. This ‘demand-following’ response rests on the theory that, as economic growth can increase the level of income in an economy, it will reduce the burden of the fixed cost associated with entering the financial sector (enabling greater financial development).  

Next, I turn to the validity of the legal origin instruments used in the 2SLS IV cross-sectional regression. Levine et al.’s cross-sectional method rests on the information provided by La Porta et al., which enables Levine et al. to support the validity of legal origins as an instrument (La Porta, et al., 1998). A country’s legal origin identifies which civil or commercial code it historically adopted (La Porta, et al., 1998, p. 1122). Whilst other economists use different classification methods on legal origins (such as including an Islamic legal origin (Wood, 2016)), I follow La Porta et al.’s classification style (categorising a country’s legal origin as of British, French, German or Scandinavian descent). So, in order to be valid, an instrument must satisfy the exogeneity condition (stating that the instrument must be uncorrelated with the error term) and the relevance condition (stating that the instrument must be correlated with the explanatory variable it is instrumenting). The legal origins of countries may satisfy the exogeneity condition due to the historic heritage. Financial laws were typically transplanted into countries via the process of colonialism (Watsin, 1974), meaning they would have little impact on any omitted variables contained in the error term (all other variables affecting current growth that are not included in the regression). Next, La Porta et al.’s findings support the relevance condition of legal origins as they find that the laws that were embedded into legal and financial framework of countries in the 17th and 18th centuries may influence the ability of the current financial system to produce quality financial services. For example: countries originating from British ‘common-law’ typically gave the strongest legal protection (in terms of the levels of enforcement and the rights attached to securities) to current investors due to this British heritage. To close the cross-sectional analysis, I use robust standard errors to allow for potential heteroskedasticity in the error terms, meaning inference will not be invalidated.  

But despite these steps taken by the cross-sectional 2SLS IV regression method in addressing issues of endogeneity, there are major flaws – most of which are rooted in this cross-sectional data type. Cross-sectional data may be worse than panel data in terms of addressing omitted variables bias and unobserved constant individual effects. This is due to the time-series element of panel data, which adds greater variability and allows for inspection of how financial development over time can affect the growth rate of a country. Furthermore, by using panel data, one can control for the unobserved constant individual effects (which were previously caught in the error term of the cross-sectional data, causing omitted variables bias in the results). Lastly, the time-series element enables the use of lagged instruments in the panel regressions, meaning the panel data regressions can control for the potential endogeneity of both the explanatory and control variables (whereas the cross-sectional data could only control for the potential endogeneity of the explanatory variables). Therefore, I run additional panel data regressions to exploit these benefits and thus better solve issues of endogeneity.   



To begin with, the ‘difference’ regression as shown by Equation 2 , involves taking the first-difference of the explanatory, controlled and dependent variables. Taking the first-difference of a variable over time removes the unobserved constant individual effects (which was previously a source of endogeneity due to its correlation with the explanatory variables (Wooldridge, 2013, p. 460)). To at least ensure ‘weakly exogenous’ variables (meaning financial development variables are correlated with current and past realisations of growth but not with future realisations), the ‘difference’ regression uses the lagged values of the explanatory and controlled variables as instruments. The ‘weakly exogenous’ assumption that future shocks to the growth rate do not impact current financial development or the controlled variables is obviously a valid assumption. Furthermore, by using cluster-robust standard errors, I control for the possibility of persistence and serial correlation in the data (Wooldridge, 2013, p. 511) (both of which invalidates inference by creating heteroskedastic error terms).  Since serial correlation is a likely consequence of panel data (due to panel data’s time series element), first-differencing is a better regression method than fixed-effects for removing the unobserved individual specific effect (Wooldridge, 2013, p. 490). Using these two assumptions of weak exogeneity and no serial correlation in the error terms, I can conclude that the lagged values are uncorrelated with the new error term (εi,t – εi,t-1), thus satisfying the exogeneity condition of the instruments. As for the relevance condition, it is quite clear that a lagged value of a variable will be sufficiently correlated with its current value.  

However, the ‘difference’ regression does not come without its own issues. By eliminating the unobserved constant individual effects, one cannot assess how cross-country differences in financial development can affect growth (thus reducing the reliability and precision of the ‘difference’ estimator). Therefore, I turn to the ‘levels’ regression. By not first-differencing the variables, I allow and control for unobserved constant individual effects, thus extracting the full effect of financial development on growth. But in order to allow the presence of unobserved constant individual effects, I must improve the quality of the instruments by using the lagged differences of variables as instruments. As shown by Levine et al., there is no correlation between the lagged difference of these variables and the unobserved constant individual effects, thus allowing for the presence of unobserved constant individual effects (Levine, et al., 2000, p. 52). As cluster-robust standard errors are again a feature of the ‘levels’ regression, I do not need to test for potential serial correlation of the error term (as was done for the ‘difference’ and ‘levels’ regressions in Levine et al.).  

With each of these three regression methods solving different areas of endogeneity, the results together may paint a more vivid and full picture of how financial development affects growth. In a somewhat sequential process: the cross-sectional regression resolves simultaneity issues, the ‘difference’ regression allows for variation over time, and finally the ‘levels’ regression improves upon the ‘difference’ regression by controlling for unobserved constant individual effects. As shown in the literature review, the results of each proxy for financial development will show how different areas of the financial system can affect growth differently. And so, with the interpretation of each proxy for each regression firmly in place, I can see if the theory presented in section 1 is truly applicable to real world data.
