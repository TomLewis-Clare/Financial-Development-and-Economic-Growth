Before looking at the results, I turn to figure 1, which illustrates the initial relationship between financial development and growth without any attempts to remove endogeneity (for example: omitted variables bias). At first, there appears to be a lack of any significant correlation between financial development and growth (supporting the ‘neutrality hypothesis’ from section 2). Using the per five period moving average trend line for each financial development indicator (to show the broader trend between financial development and growth with less outlier bias), higher growth rates do not seem to be accompanied with higher levels of financial development. In accordance with the growth-enhancing view of financial development discussed in section 1, one would expect the peak of variables such as PRIVY to be located at the far right side of the graph (as opposed to being roughly in the middle as in figure 1). It is worth noting here that PRIVY and LLY follow a closer trend than BANK, which may be reflected in the regression results. So, as shown by figure 1’s fairly random trend in financial development and economic growth, the more sophisticated econometric technique outlined in section 3 is needed to accurately test for the existence of section 1’s theory using real world data.

Next, it is important to examine how closely related the distribution of the legal origins are in respect to those used in Levine et al. to assess the consistency of the cross-sectional regression technique used in this paper. As I am employing roughly the same econometric technique as Levine et al., then one would expect the legal origins of countries to report similar effects on the financial development indicators. Figure 2 supports the results of Levine et al.’s regressions, in which countries with a German legal origin are accompanied with a better-functioning financial system as shown by the financial development proxies reporting higher values than those of the other legal origins. This suggests that the cross-sectional results produced in this paper should conform to the cross-sectional results of Levine et al..

A final check employed is on the level of variation in the data, which is displayed by the table 1 (summary statistics). There is large variation across countries in terms of both financial development and growth. For example, in terms of the financial sector size, LLY is below 20% of GDP for developing African countries such as Niger, Cameroon and Ghana, whilst for more developed countries such as Japan and Switzerland, LLY is above 100% of GDP.  This variation in the dataset may provide sufficient evidence to support the random sampling assumption of linear models as it shows how the data is truly representative of the global population of countries (Wooldridge, 2013, p. 59). The validity of these linear model assumptions will lend support to the unbiasedness of the regression estimator in each of the three regressions.

The cross-sectional results reported in table 2 indicate weak support for any significant connection between the exogenous component of financial development and economic growth (shown by the insignificance reported by the p values). To fully encapsulate the meaning of the insignificance reported between financial development and growth, a closer inspection of the coefficients is required. For example: the coefficient on PRIVY for the policy conditioning set shows that, when all controlled variables are held constant, a 1% increase in PRIVY will lead to a 0.2% increase in growth. But upon closer inspection, the coefficients show that when a country moves from the average PRIVY for low income countries (12.7% of GDP) to the average PRIVY for high income countries (74.8% of GDP), they would only yield 1.2% increase in growth. This is a small payoff considering the monumental required increase in PRIVY of 62.1% of GDP needed, proving the insignificance of the relationship reported in table 2.  

As for the panel data results, tables 3 and 4 reveal there to be some significance between financial development and growth, but not in the growth-enhancing direction as predicted by the theory discussed in section 1. To begin with, the ‘difference’ regression in table 3 shows a significantly negative effect on growth for LLY and PRIVY under the simple conditioning set (at the 10% and 5% significance level, respectively), but a significantly negative effect on growth only for PRIVY under the policy conditioning set (at the 5% significance level). This shows how LLY suffers from omitted variables bias under the simple conditioning set, as the additional variables in the policy conditioning set affect growth and are correlated with financial development . In the policy conditioning set, Table 3 shows that a 1% increase in the first-difference of PRIVY will decrease the first-difference of growth by 0.1% (when instrumented by its lag). For table 4, the policy conditioning set shows that a 1% increase in PRIVY will decrease growth by 0.04% (when instrumented by its difference in lags). The difference in the significance and direction between the financial indicators in the panel regression tables supports Mensah et al. (2013) and Perera & Paudel’s (2009) claim discussed in section 2 that different financial development proxies report different relationships. So, in order to determine a definitive acceptance or rejection of the theory in section 1, I consider which financial development proxy best tests the existence of Levine’s ‘functional approach’ and Pagano’s ‘AK model’. As discussed in King and Levine (1993), a higher PRIVY means more credit is funnelled to the private sector as opposed to state-owned enterprise, meaning the financial system is placing more emphasis on the five financial functions outlined in Levine’s ‘functional approach’  (King & Levine, 1993, p. 721). Therefore, with the improved accuracy (in terms of data) of the panel regressions over the cross-sectional regressions, the significantly negative coefficient on PRIVY in tables 3 and 4 shows that financial development may be detrimental to growth, disproving the growth-enhancing view presented by section 1.  

To evaluate this conclusion, I run several sensitivity checks. To assess the sensitivity of the financial development indicators, I repeat the cross-sectional and panel data regressions using different financial development indicators, in which: BANK is reproduced by DEPST_GDP (measuring the size of deposit money bank assets to GDP), LLY by FINDEPST_GDP (measuring the value of financial sector deposits to GDP) and PRIVY by PRIVDEPST_GDP (measuring the ratio of credit to the private sector issued by banks, to GDP).  I find no changes in significance, except for DEPST_GDP, which reports different results for the panel regressions to its predecessor -  BANK. Furthermore, I examine whether the income group of the country affects the relationship between financial development and growth (as shown by Yang (2018) in section 2). By repeating the regressions using only high income OECD countries, I find no changes in the significance levels of the results, except for PRIVY in tables 3 and 4 reporting an insignificant coefficient (compared to being significantly negative). As a final sensitivity check, I identify the labelled countries that lie furthest from the line of best fit in figure 3 as outliers. I repeat original regressions without the outliers in the dataset, but report no changes in significance (meaning outliers cannot be driving the results).  

In view of the sensitivity check on income groups, it could be the case that developing countries report a more negative relationship between financial development and growth than developed countries. This leads me to consider the possibility that potential distortions caused by multinational companies (MNCs) on host economies (which are commonly developing countries) may be driving the significantly negative result reported by PRIVY in the panel regressions. MNCs may distort the financial development of a host economy by not fully taking part in the host economy’s financial system, for example: not being listed in the host economy’s stock exchange or repatriating profits. In accordance with Levine’s theory, a rise in PRIVY could be caused by more credit being funnelled to the private firms that are likely to generate high returns, such as MNCs. But as these MNCs have a tendency to repatriate their profits, the financial resources channelled to MNCs may be withdrawn from the host economy, leading to lower growth rates than if these financial resources had been channelled to the private firms that would have kept their profits in the host economy.  

To test this assumption that MNC profit repatriation is what makes PRIVY significantly negative, I substitute the growth variable Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with Gross National Product (GNP)  from the World Bank. The profits generated by MNCs will be reflected in the host country’s GDP rate but not its GNP rate, meaning GNP does not account for MNC repatriated profit (Perkins, et al., 2013). Running the ‘levels’ policy set regression using GNP produces a positive but insignificant result for PRIVY, showing that MNC profit repatriation could at least account for part of the significantly negative coefficient on PRIVY.  

However, to complete the evaluation of the results it appears that key issues in the dataset may impede any credible conclusions being made from tables 2, 3 and 4. In terms of the cross-sectional regressions, the data on legal origins may be unrepresentative of the population (as whilst there are data on 35 French and 22 British legal origin countries, there are only 3 on German and Scandinavian). In support of this, the distribution of financial development across different legal origins (as shown by figure 2) does not conform to La Porta et al.’s results (which showed the British legal origin to indicate the most financially developed countries). Furthermore, whilst table 1 suggests the data exhibit variation, the variation is greatly limited by the exclusion of the current top 10 countries as a share of GDP (including China, Germany, UK, France and Canada (Worldometer, 2020)), contributing to the bias.  

To conclude, the initial results reported in tables 2, 3 and 4 do not support the growth-enhancing view of financial development posed by Pagano and Levine; but upon closer inspection, this may be accounted for by the effects of MNCs on host economies. But a potentially more noteworthy implication of this paper that may further the debate on the finance-growth relationship is that GNP may be a preferable proxy for economic growth, as it controls for the effect that profit repatriation has on the finance-growth relationship. However, with the weaknesses in the dataset, the results in this paper cannot categorically prove or disprove the theory presented in section 1, but can act as a further avenue of enquiry for future economists to test this growth-enhancing theory.
