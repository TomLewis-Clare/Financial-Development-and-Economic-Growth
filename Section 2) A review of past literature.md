A monumental economic debate exists between economists in determining the magnitude and direction of the relationship between financial development and economic growth. Whilst earlier work on this debate tends to suggest that it is financial development that fuels economic growth (Bagehot, 1873) (Schumpeter, 1912) (Hicks, 1969), more recent studies may give support to the possibility that it is growth that fuels financial development.  

Opoku et al. discuss the different schools of thought on the finance-growth nexus (Opoku, et al., 2019). These theories include the ‘supply-leading hypothesis’, the ‘demand-following hypothesis’, the ‘feedback hypothesis’ and the ‘neutrality hypothesis’. The ‘supply-leading hypothesis’ explains how financial development leads to economic growth (Abu-Bader & Abu-Qarn, 2008). The ‘demand-following hypothesis’ shows that economic growth fuels financial development by increasing the demand for financial services (Odhiambo, 2004). The ‘feedback hypothesis’ claims there to be a duplex (or bi-directional) causality path between financial development and economic growth (Akinboade, 1998). Lastly, the ‘neutrality hypothesis’ reports an insignificant relationship between financial development and economic growth (Atindehou, et al., 2005). In this particular study, Opoku et al. use a panel of 47 African countries over the period 1980-2016. They construct a robust measure of financial development by using a range of indices on the depth, access and efficiency of the financial institutions in a country. Using a frequency-domain spectral causality technique, they examine the causality effect in the short, medium and long run of the ‘supply-leading’ and ‘demand-following’ hypothesises, which actually resulted in evidence for the ‘neutrality’ hypothesis on the finance-growth link.  

Leading on from this, Akinboade uses country-specific time series data between 1972-1995 to examine the direction of causality between financial development and economic growth in Botswana (Akinboade, 1998). Botswana is an interesting case study as it went from being one of the poorest countries globally in 1966 to becoming a middle income economy by 1980s (and this time period is roughly contained in the dataset range). He measures Botswana’s economic growth by the real non-mineral GDP per capita (to exclude the bias coming from the immense influence of Botswana’s mineral sector), and measures the financial development by the ratio of bank claims on private sector to nominal and non-mineral GDP and by the ratio of bank deposit liabilities to nominal non-mineral GDP. Using the Granger causality technique, Akinboade finds a bi-directional causality loop between the financial development and economic growth indicators, thus supporting the ‘feedback’ hypothesis.  

Other economists find evidence of the ‘demand-following’ hypothesis. Using time series data on South Africa between 1986-2000, Odhiambo investigated the direction of causality between financial development and economic growth (Odhiambo, 2004). He regressed three proxies for financial development (a monetarisation variable, a currency ratio and a ratio of bank claims on the private sector to nominal GDP) against a proxy for economic growth (real per capita income). Since these variables are non-stationary, he uses first-differencing to transform them into stationary ones. His results then revealed evidence of a ‘demand-following’ response between financial development and economic growth.  

Meanwhile, economists such as Guru and Yadav find further evidence to support the ‘supply-leading’ theory (Guru & Yadav, 2019). Using a panel of the five emerging BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) over the period 1993-2014, they model the relationship between financial development and economic growth. Using BRICS economies enables the authors to make broader external conclusions as the BRICS economies have contrasting economic growth rates (ranging from 1.18%-9.14% (Guru & Yadav, 2019, p. 115)), whilst being largely free from bias as they are mostly heterogeneous (such as by geographical region). They model a country’s banking sector development by its size, credit to deposit ratio and the domestic credit to private sector (CPS), and model its stock market development by the value of shares traded and the turnover ratio. With real GDP as a proxy for economic growth, they use the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) system estimation to estimate the finance-growth link. The results obtained not only supported the ‘supply-leading’ hypothesis, but also showed that there is no trade-off between the development of banks and of stock markets since they complement each other.  

Moving beyond the debate on the direction of causality, some economists find that the initial level of economic development can determine the relationship between financial development and economic growth. First off, Skully et al. use panel data on 90 countries between 1980-2011 to test if the stage of a country’s economic development impacts the finance-growth link (Skully, et al., 2019). Using a system GMM method with 3 dummy variables (low, middle and high income), they test the significance of 4 financial development proxies (banking, stock market, bond market and insurance) on growth. As these dummy variables reported different results on the finance-growth connection for different income groups, the exact relationship on the finance-growth link must instead depend on their initial level of economic development. Using a full sample period (1980-2011) and a pre-crisis period (1980-2006), they also find that financial crashes can impact upon the ability of stock markets to fuel growth in high income countries.  

Yang advances this assessment of the effect of initial economic development on the relationship (Yang, 2018). Using data from the World Bank over the period 1970-2015, Yang divides 47 countries into 3 categories: ‘trapped’ middle-income (countries that began as middle income countries in 1970 and remained this way by 2015), ‘graduated’ middle-income (countries that also began as middle-income countries but managed to grow into high-income countries) and high-income (countries that began and ended as high-income countries). Using the financial development indicators: ‘broad money’, credit to private sector and size/liquidity of stock markets, he models time series tests to identify the causality relationships between economic growth and financial development indicators for the different income groups. The results of this test enabled Yang to suggest that middle-income countries are ‘trapped’ due to the development of their banking sector. The more credit provided to the economy via banking, the higher the inflation (and vice-versa) and this higher inflation impedes growth (suggesting that financial development in the banking sector is detrimental to growth).  

In examining the broader causes behind the relationship, Haber examines the effect of political regimes on the levels of finance restrictions in an economy and their impact on the finance-growth link (Haber, 1991). Using time series data on the US, Brazil and Mexico over the period 1840-1930, he examines how the four-firm industrial concentration ratio of the textile industry is affected by changes in financial development (choosing the textile industry as the lack of barriers to entry means that changes in the concentration can be directly attributed to changes in financial development). With the concentrations initially similar between Mexico and Brazil, the overthrow of the Brazilian monarchy in 1889 led to the Brazilian financial markets becoming considerably more liberalised than Mexico. With this greater access to credit in Brazil, the textile industrial concentration fell from 0.357 in 1880 to 0.161 in 1930, increasing industrial production and thus growth. Meanwhile, the constant concentration in Mexico shows how restrictions can be detrimental to growth regardless of any changes in financial development.  

Rajan and Zingales advance the debate by showing that financial development can reduce the cost of external finance, meaning industries that are more dependent on external finance will benefit more from financial development (Rajan & Zingales, 1998). Using the cost of external finance as an instrumental variable for financial development, they model the causal effect of financial development on growth. Using a large cross-section of countries, they measure the external financial dependence of an industry by summing firms’ capital expenditures over the period 1980-90. They found that when young firms are externally dependent, financial development had twice the impact on growth compared with the mature less externally dependent firms. Assuming young firms are a major source of innovation, then these results imply that financial development that permits the emergence of young firms may better enhance growth.  

Other economists examine the reasons behind these contrasting results for the finance-growth link. Mensah et al. use time series data from Ghana between 1961-2010 to show that the growth effect of financial development is sensitive to the particular proxy used (Mensah, et al., 2013). The initially large number of proxies (eight) makes their regression vulnerable to multicollinearity (due to high correlation between proxies in such a small sample), leading to them applying principal component analysis to produce four sub-proxies of financial development (which still explain 95% of the total variation but don’t have the between-proxy correlation). They find that the sub-proxies ‘credit to the private sector as a ratio of GDP’ and ‘total domestic credit’ have statistically positive effects on growth rates, whilst the sub-proxy ‘broad money stock to GDP ratio’ has a statistically negative effect. These results support their theory that the decision on which financial development proxy to use can determine the growth effect of financial development.  

Perera & Paudel complement Mensah el al.’s view that different indicators for financial development determine the results for the relationship between financial development and economic growth (Perera & Paudel, 2009). Using time series data on Sri Lanka between 1955-2005, they construct six measures of financial development and they test the cointegration between financial development and growth using Johansen’s Vector Autoregression Approach. After finding cointegration between economic and financial development variables, they then use an error correction model to perform a Granger causality test. These results report a two-way causality loop between the financial development variable ‘broad money’ and economic growth, whilst other financial development variables such as ‘private sector credit’ report a one-way causality path from financial development to economic growth.  

To conclude, some economists have shown that the direction of causality flows from financial development to economic growth, whilst others have shown the reverse. Additionally, some have shown a bi-directional causality path or none at al. Furthermore, it has been shown that initial levels of economic development can also determine this relationship. Moreover, economists point out that there are certain factors that can spur this relationship, such as political liberalisations on finance or the number of young vs. mature firms in the economy. To close, the reasons for these different results can be attributed to the authors’ decisions on which financial development proxies to use, as considered in the sensitivity analysis of section 4.
