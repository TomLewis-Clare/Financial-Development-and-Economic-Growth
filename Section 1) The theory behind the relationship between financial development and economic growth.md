<h4 align="center"> Section 1: The theory behind the relationship between financial development and economic growth </h4> 
<hr />  

The theories put forward by Pagano’s ‘AK’ model and Levine’s ‘functional approach’ describe how financial development can accelerate growth.  Pagano’s ‘AK’ model can be used to briefly explain the theory behind the positive impact of financial development on economic growth (Pagano, 1993), but Levine’s ‘functional approach’ gives a more detailed understanding of relationship between the financial structures and functioning of the financial system in the economy, and thus better describes how financial development can fuel economic growth (Levine, 1997).  

To begin with, Pagano illustrates the link between financial development and economic growth via the ‘AK’ model as shown in equation 1. Part (1) shows that productivity in a firm (‘A’) is an increasing function of the aggregate capital stock (‘Kt’). Part (2) shows that gross investment is equal to capital in the next period minus the depreciation of capital in the current period. Part (3) shows that, in a closed economy, investment is equal to the amount of savings not expended in the process of financial intermediation (financial intermediaries are institutions that bridge the gap between borrowers and lenders (firms and savers, respectively) (Efayena, 2014)). Combining the parts (1), (2) and (3) of the equation, Pagano computes the steady-state growth rate as part (4). Ceteris paribus, this steady state equation shows that financial development can affect growth by influencing the saving rate (‘s’), increasing the social marginal propensity of capital (‘A’) or by raising the proportion of savings channelled to investment ‘ø’.

However, it is important to take a step back and examine the financial structures that must first exist to enable these effects on growth – as outlined by Levine’s ‘functional approach’. Financial markets and institutions arise to minimise the costs associated with acquiring information and making transactions. These cost minimisations can be achieved by five financial functions: risk amelioration, resource allocation and information acquisition, corporate control, savings mobilisation and the facilitation of exchange. These functions help promote growth via the channels of capital accumulation and technological innovations.  

So, taken together, the two prongs of Pagano’s ‘AK’ model and Levine’s ‘functional approach’ help illustrate the sequential process by which financial development affects growth. Levine’s theory effectively sets the scene by discussing the financial structures that must first exist to enable financial development to affect growth, whilst Pagano’s theory gives a more detailed analysis of how financial development affects growth via two growth channels (capital accumulation and technological innovation).  However, as admitted by Pagano himself, the direction of the relationship between financial development and economic growth is often ambiguous (Pagano, 1993, p. 616) as it will depend on the particular financial market concerned. Therefore, greater examination of the five functions outlined in Levine’s ‘functional approach’ can enable a clearer evaluation of how financial development affects economic growth in different financial markets.  

The first financial function, risk amelioration, can help savers overcome the liquidity risk and idiosyncratic risk associated with holding an asset. The liquidity risk is the inability of an economic agent to exchange their wealth for goods and services (Nikolaou, 2009), due to informational asymmetries (the imbalance of information between buyer and seller) whilst idiosyncratic risk is the firm-specific risk caused by changes in the price of an asset (Market Business News, 2020). By mitigating these risks through risk amelioration, financial development enhances economic growth by incentivising savers to invest in more high-return projects. To begin with, liquidity risk arises when savers investing must renounce control of their savings for long periods of time, (Diamond & Dybvig, 1983) restricting their propensity to invest in illiquid long term but high return investments. Following on from the Diamond-Dyvbig model, financial intermediaries may encourage greater investment in these less popular high-return illiquid investments by investing in a diversified mixture of low-return liquid and high-return illiquid investments to provide immediate liquidity to deposit holders. Savers are now more incentivised by high-return illiquid investments, as this diversification provides immediate liquidity to deposit holders and so with more capital flowing to these high-return and more profitable investments, growth will accelerate. Liquidity risk also means that savers may be less inclined to invest in those productive technologies which have long gestation periods, due to the transaction cost of transferring ownership of the investment to different individuals over the lifetime of the investment (Bencivenga, et al., 1996). Therefore, secondary securities markets emerge to ameliorate these transaction costs (such as by facilitating communication between the buyer and holder of the security), reducing the liquidity risk of assets with long gestation periods. And so, in the same way as before, with more capital flowing to productive and efficient technologies, economic growth will rise. Lastly, financial intermediaries may reduce idiosyncratic risk via risk diversification. By combining risky and non-risky investments, financial intermediaries allow savers to invest in risky high-return projects as they will be less exposed to the risk aspect (Saint-Paul, 1991).  

Levine’s next function is information acquisition i.e. the way in which financial systems facilitate the information acquisition of investments in order to reduce the information costs faced by savers. These costs arise as savers lack the capability to accumulate information on investments (such as the economic conditions affecting an investment); this is detrimental to growth as savers are discouraged from investing in areas with little information available, but with the potential to generate large returns. Therefore, financial intermediaries step in with the skills needed to appraise investments and select the most successful firms that will generate the highest returns (Greenwood & Jovanovic, 1990). This information will be passed onto the savers, incentivising savers to invest in high-return projects (leading to improvements in growth via the channel of capital accumulation). Moreover, the public accessibility of share prices reported by financial institutions - such as stock markets – can also indicate to savers the probability of high returns on a particular investment. The public accessibility of share prices may reduce information costs as savers can see for themselves the profitability of investments (without the need for evaluation by financial intermediaries). Therefore, with less resources wasted acquiring information, more will be available for investment. So with stock markets and financial intermediaries indicating which firms to invest in, capital will flow to the most efficient firm and stimulate higher rates of growth.  

Moving on, Levine considers the role of corporate control. As defined by Ruback and Jensen, the market for corporate control involves managerial groups interacting with one another in order to get the exclusive right to manage corporate resources (Ruback & Jensen, 1983, p. 1). The provision of corporate control by financial intermediaries will reduce the monitoring costs and (indirectly) the asymmetric costs of a firm’s activities; I say indirectly as through monitoring, firms are less able to falsify information, thus reducing asymmetric costs. Asymmetric costs occur when a party has private information that another party does not have, so when both of these parties interact, there is market failure (such as in the form of adverse selection) (Sell & Reese, 2014). To begin with, financial instruments such as collateral and financial contracts can be used to lower these monitoring and asymmetric costs (Williamson, 1986). Delving deeper into the effects of financial contracts, by binding the contractual terms to current actions, the borrower will only receive the second part of the contract if the borrower does not default in the first period. And so, by the law of large numbers, if this process is repeated over time then the default rate will give information about the ability of the firm (Webb, 1991). Therefore, by the financial system enabling the monitoring of firms, information costs are minimised, so more resources will be directed towards efficient projects, which will prompt growth. Going one step further on this, financial intermediaries may be able to economise on monitoring costs to keep them as minimal as possible. This is because the benefits yielded by monitoring a firm can be extended to large number of savers, diminishing the monitoring cost to each individual saver (Diamond, 1984).  Monitoring costs are further minimised by the financial intermediary holding a diversified portfolio, meaning savers will have no need to monitor the intermediary (as the intermediary should always be able to pay out). In addition, with the long-run relationships between financial intermediaries and firms, information costs will be kept even lower due to the ‘learning effect’ of repeated lending to the firm (Sharpe, 1990). Thus, these ongoing improvements in the financial intermediaries’ knowledge of firms will make the evaluation of firms by financial intermediaries more credible to savers (enticing them to invest). To conclude, the greater implementation of corporate control by financial intermediaries may keep monitoring and information costs to a minimum. This should encourage greater investment by savers, and so improve growth.  

Upon closer inspection of the role of corporate control, the existence of stock markets may enable greater corporate control both within the firm and between the firm and its owners (further reducing costs). Between the firm and owners, owners may exert corporate control over the managers by compensating the managers in line with the stock price, assuming owners take the public stock share information about the firm as an indication of the performance of the firm (Diamond & Verrecchia, 1982). This control may be intensified as, by stock markets facilitating the takeovers of inefficient firms, the credibility of a takeover threat is exacerbated. So monitoring costs are kept even lower because managers are incentivised to act in accordance with the preferences of the owners in keeping the share price up without the need for the owners to monitor the managers (Scharfstein, 1988). These reductions in monitoring costs within a firm free up more resources for reinvestment in a firm, again enhancing growth.  

Next, financial systems provide the mobilisation of savings to bridge firms’ capital demands with savers’ investment demands. When firms are restricted to their own earnings, they are constrained to produce at inefficient levels (Crane, et al., 1995). Without any connections, firms may be unable to mobilise savings for themselves, and are unwilling to pay the vast transaction costs associated with locating potential investors. Therefore, financial intermediaries arise to mobilise savings for the firms. Financial intermediaries mitigate information asymmetries by gaining a trustworthy reputation (such as by obtaining an official government approval), incentivising savers to entrust their savings to the intermediary (De Long, 1991). Furthermore, financial intermediaries lower the transaction costs associated with collecting savings from a variety of individuals by establishing connections that will deliver capital on a large scale. This can be exemplified by the way in which US investment banks used European connections to raise capital abroad for investment in the US in the 1880s (Carosso, 1970). To finish, financial intermediaries can economise on transaction costs and information costs. Multilateral contracts between a set of investors and a set of firms lead to thousands of investors commending their wealth to a single financial intermediary, which can then invest in hundreds of firms (Crane, et al., 1995). By exponentially lowering the costs of firms raising capital, they are better able to take advantage of economies of scale, bringing greater efficiency to production and thus enhancing growth.  

Levine’s final factor is that financial markets enable greater specialisation by facilitating exchange. According to Adam Smith, specialisation will lead to big productivity improvements as workers that specialise foster a “learning-by-doing” effect, which channels into higher growth rates by enabling technological innovation (Smith, 1776). Since specialisation requires more transactions, financial arrangements that lower transaction costs can enable more efficient specialisation (Greenwood & Smith, 1997). The facilitation of exchange may lower transaction costs as, by introducing an easily recognisable medium of exchange, less resources are used to evaluate the returns on a good. Therefore, as the facilitation of exchange enables greater specialisation, so too can it enhance growth rates.  

Having discussed the theory in some detail, I now turn to the literature on the finance-growth link to provide evidence supporting this theory using real world data.
