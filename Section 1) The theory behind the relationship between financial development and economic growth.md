<h4 align="center"> Section 1: The theory behind the relationship between financial development and economic growth </h4> 
<hr />  

The theories put forward by Pagano’s ‘AK’ model and Levine’s ‘functional approach’ describe how financial development can accelerate growth.  Pagano’s ‘AK’ model can be used to briefly explain the theory behind the positive impact of financial development on economic growth (Pagano, 1993), but Levine’s ‘functional approach’ gives a more detailed understanding of relationship between the financial structures and functioning of the financial system in the economy, and thus better describes how financial development can fuel economic growth (Levine, 1997).  
To begin with, Pagano illustrates the link between financial development and economic growth via the ‘AK’ model as shown in equation 1. Part (1) shows that productivity in a firm (‘A’) is an increasing function of the aggregate capital stock (‘Kt’). Part (2) shows that gross investment is equal to capital in the next period minus the depreciation of capital in the current period. Part (3) shows that, in a closed economy, investment is equal to the amount of savings not expended in the process of financial intermediation (financial intermediaries are institutions that bridge the gap between borrowers and lenders (firms and savers, respectively) (Efayena, 2014)). Combining the parts (1), (2) and (3) of the equation, Pagano computes the steady-state growth rate as part (4). Ceteris paribus, this steady state equation shows that financial development can affect growth by influencing the saving rate (‘s’), increasing the social marginal propensity of capital (‘A’) or by raising the proportion of savings channelled to investment ‘ø’.
