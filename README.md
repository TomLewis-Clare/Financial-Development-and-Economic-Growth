<h4 align="center"> Abstract </h4>  

This paper examines whether the growth-enhancing view of financial development posed by Levine (1997) and Pagano (1993) can be proven with real world data. I attempt to address issues of endogeneity using Levine et al.’s (2000) Two Stage Least Squares Instrumental Variable (2SLS IV) method for cross-sectional and panel data. For the cross-sectional data, by using the legal origins of a country as an instrumental variable for financial development, I find an insignificant relationship between financial development and growth. With the panel data, I run a ‘difference’ regression (using lagged variables as instruments) and a ‘levels’ regression (using the lagged differences as instruments). For both of these panel data regressions, I find a mixture of insignificant and negatively significant coefficients. Upon closer inspection, these results may be driven by external factors, and so a broader consideration of these factors may provide a fruitful avenue for future research on the causal relationship between financial development and economic growth.
